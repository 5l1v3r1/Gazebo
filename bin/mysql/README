Database helper scripts for gazebo storage. Obviously needs a database server (mysql)
running on some accessible host that has been set up with the proper schema. Also, the
perl DBD module mysql.pm must be available to the host that attempts to connect to the DB. 

Instructions for setting up this server are not covered here. However, the gazebo schema
sql file (gazebo.sql) is included here to help create the gazebo database.

General "user" accounts should be created with read/write/update/view permissions on the
gazebo database tables. Edit the .dbcfg file in the GZHOME directory so these scripts can 
do their work.

Some of these scripts are merely here for example purposes. However, the storeresultsDBI
script is the workhorse script that uploads test result data.

Gazebo will run and store test results in the configured test results directory even if no
database exists. If at a later time a database is created all the test results can be up-loaded
into the database with the gz_uploadLogs2DB script found in the GZBIN directory.
