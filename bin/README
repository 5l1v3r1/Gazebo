This directory contains the crux of all the Gazebo software.

This suite of programs has evolved over time as people have created utilities to help with
our HPC system testing and new system acceptance. Some of the main worker programs
like atc_run, atc_testMgr, setUpandRun, atc_coverage, gzjobs, and atc_results are quite
mature and have been heavily used.  However, there are others that may be considered to
be beta level, and yet others somewhere in between. 

Feel free to use or offer ideas for future development and even develop some new software if you like.
If you want to be involved let us know since we have ideas for improvment also. 

Thanks.
