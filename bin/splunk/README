This directory contains software specific to SPLUNK related work.  Splunk is a commercial product and is
not released as part of Gazebo. However, Gazebo can be used without a Splunk infrastructure in place. 

At LANL, Gazebo also uses Splunk as a data analysis tool. Splunk expects data in a much different format
than the standard Gazebo output. The td2splunkData utility will read the job results log file and create
a my.splunkdata file placing in it native Splunk format records. Basically, a few noteworthy 
values are saved, along with all the trenddata values and written as key value pairs into this new file.

The td2splunkData script will run at the end of each Gazebo job. td2splunkData will not overwrite
an existing *.splunkdata file.  This allows the test developer, if so inclined, to generate their own splunk data.

- to see how td2splunkData works:
1) remove the *.splunkdata file from the CWD, if the file exists.
2) run "./td2splunkData <target_log_dir>".  A "." will work if the log file exists in the CWD.
3) a my.splunkdata file is generated in the CWD
