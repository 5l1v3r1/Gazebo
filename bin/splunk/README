Gazebo is using Splunk as a data analysis tool. Splunk expects events in a much different format
than the standard gazebo output log. For compatiblity purposes the td2splunkData utility will create
a my.splunkdata file from any trend data that is generated from a test and put it into native Splunk
format.

Splunk is a commercial product and is not released as part of Gazebo. However, Gazebo can be use just
fine without a Splunk infrastructure in place. 

td2splunkData will not over write an existing *.splunkdata file.  However, to see how this works:
1) remove the my.splunkdata file
2) run "./td2splunkData ."
