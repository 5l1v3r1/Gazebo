This script is intended to "manually" run a test.
It expects you to have already executed a command like:
    msub -I -V -l nodes=2:cu14
(where cu14 is the moab partition name for the segment on
 which you wish to run, and 2 here is the number of nodes
 desired for this test run)
This script sets up the environment and executes the script
you have specified in the test config file as your test executable.

Usage:  $0 <testname> <npes>
