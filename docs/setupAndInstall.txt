 ***  Basic install and setup instructions  ***

Install:

 From a tar file:

 - untar the gazebo-x.tgz file into some <install directory> that is
   mounted on BOTH the management node (a.k.a as a login node or a front end node)
   and the compute nodes.

 - set the environment variable GZHOME to <install directory>/gazebo-1.x

 - set the environment variable GZBIN to $GZHOME/bin

 - include both $GZBIN and $GZHOME in your search PATH

 - run the gzinstall script that resides in the $GZBIN directory

  NOTE - multiple instantiations of GZBIN are allowed.

 RPM:

  - On a DOE TOSS based machine this may already be installed. Contact your administrator.

  - make a <install dir> directory where you want all your tests to run from
    and set an environment variable GZHOME to that. This directory must be mounted on
    BOTH the management node and all the compute nodes.

  - set the environment variable GZBIN to the location where the Gazebo binaries are located. The
    default location on the TOSS systems is /opt/gazebo-x.x/bin for instance.

 - include both $GZBIN and $GZHOME in your search PATH

 - run the gzinstall script that resides in the $GZBIN directory


Setup:

 - There are three files that must be edited before you can get started. Each are discussed
   in the README and are documented in-line. As a heads up...

     gazebo.conf - master config file that describes the system
     submit_configs/test_config_<name> - test suite definition (define what tests to run)
     test_exec/<test_name>/gzconfig - individual test configuration file, one per test directory. An example
     exists in the /test_exec/simple directory.
