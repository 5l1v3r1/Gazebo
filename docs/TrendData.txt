Trend Data 
==========

Specific test/job related values can be recorded by Gazebo if they are save as trend data.
Trend data is simply noted by printing a separate line for each trend data name to STDOUT.
Multiple trend data values can be saved for every test run. This 
data is defined by the application developer.


Syntax:
<td> name value [units]

Explanation:
<td> - tag or marker used by the Gazebo parser.
# the next three lines are defined by the test developer
name - char string, up to 32 chars. Name of the trend data item.   
value - char string, up to 64 chars
units - char string, up to 24 chars.

Rules:
- One name value entry per line.
- The units field is optional.
- The <td> tag must start at the beginning of the line.
- Lines with a duplicate name entry will be ignored.
- A Maximum of 4k entries are allowed per test. 
- No spaces are allowed in any of the components. Gazebo expects at least three fields.
- The value entry is a number
- underlines are recommended as opposed to dashed in the name field. 

Examples:
<td> IB0_max_rate 250 MB/sec
<td> IB1_max_rate 220 MB/sec
<td> n-n_write_bw_max 100 MB/sec
<td> phase_1_data 4700 
<td> phase_2_data 8200 


Querying Data:
  Trend data can be viewed using the Gazebo atc_results script
with the "-T" option. Data is harvested from the log file in the test results directory.
More analysis tools are available to view trend data results. See
gazebo_analyzeTD and gazebo_analyzeTD2.

Splunk: 
  As of release 1.4.4 all trend data is automatically harvested and place into a file called *.mysplunkdata in the
final results directory. Describing Splunk is outside the scope of Gazebo, but for you splunkers this data is now
created in native Splunk format.
